            <h3>Info</h3>
            This site has a 3 question quiz about military aviation. A brief history of military aviation can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aviation" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
            <br> Aviation has been a strategic part of military operations since it has existed. Originally balloons and low power 
            <br> biplanes were used for observation and eventually used for bombing and later were equpped with guns, missiles, 
            <br> and electronic equpment. Not all military operations are used in battle, however, most missions involving the
            <br> use of aircraft are humanitarian or training in nature. My favorite aircraft, the Lockheed A-12 
            <br> (variants YF-12 and SR-71) had no offensive capabilities at all - only cameras and electronic
            <br> logging equipment.
